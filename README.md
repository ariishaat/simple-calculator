# simple-calculator

### Quick Overview

Created this simple calculator with a light and dark mode using HTML, CSS, and JS. I was interested in learning how to make a light and dark mode feature so I thought following a similar calculator project would help. [Codepen preview here](https://codepen.io/ariishaat/pen/OJEKGpr)

Some helpful links I used for making this:
